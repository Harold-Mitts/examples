This PowerShell script is designed to retrieve and display comprehensive data about Microsoft Teams in a tenant, 
including the names and IDs of teams, their owners, members, and associated channels.

The script is intended for use by system administrators, IT professionals, and other individuals responsible for 
managing Microsoft Teams environments, especially those overseeing large or complex organizations. By providing 
detailed insights about each team's structure and users, the script aids in the efficient management and administration 
of Microsoft Teams. It can be particularly useful during audits, user management tasks, or when a high-level overview 
of Teams structure is required.

To use the script, one must have the necessary permissions to access Microsoft Teams data in the target tenant, 
as well as the PowerShell Teams module installed. The output is provided directly to the console for immediate review 
or further processing.

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access Microsoft Teams data within your organization's tenant. You should typically be an administrator to use this script.

Copy the script into a new .ps1 file. This is easier than attempting to pass an unsigned script. You can author the script in your editor to avoid execution policy.

After you have created your script, open Windows Terminal, connect to Microsoft-Teams, and run your script.
